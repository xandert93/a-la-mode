// Nike made each a <input:radio> (interesting). But all sites seemed to perform a HTTP request each time a size was picked. Something to explore and revisit later.

  Gonna leave product details, features and colours for now. Need to determine type of eCommerce
  For example, if clothing, customer usually just impulsively look at image and buys - details/features are commonly hidden in accordion
  But for electronics, where customer makes a considered purchase, description and feature list must be immediately visible
